;;;   to construct a FOO class object, or
;;;   (<arbitrary-name> <class-name>) which will create a
;;;   function named <arbitrary-name> that will create an object
;;;   of type <class-name)
;;; a &REST argument that is a list of keyword argument specifications.
;;;   These will be either keyword argument names (symbols) or two-element
;;;   lists, where the first element is the name, and the second is a type
;;;   specifier.  Names do *not* need to be in the keyword package --
;;;   the macro will take care of that.
;;; Also generates a type declaration for the function.
